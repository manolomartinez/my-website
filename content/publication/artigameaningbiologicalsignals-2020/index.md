abstract: 'We introduce the virtual special issue on content in signalling systems.
  The issue explores the uses and limits of ideas from evolutionary game theory and
  information theory for explaining the content of biological signals. We explain
  the basic idea of the Lewis-Skyrms sender-receiver framework, and we highlight three
  key themes of the issue: (i) the challenge of accounting for deception, misinformation
  and false content, (ii) the relevance of partial or total common interest to the
  evolution of meaningful signals, and (iii) how the sender-receiver framework relates
  to teleosemantics.'
