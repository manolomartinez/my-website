 abstract = {Recent work on signaling has mostly focused on communication between organisms. The Lewis– Skyrms framework should be equally applicable to intra-organismic signaling. We present a Lewis– Skyrms signaling-game model of painful signaling, and use it to argue that the content of pain is predominantly imperative. We address several objections to the account, concluding that our model gives a productive framework within which to consider internal signaling.},
