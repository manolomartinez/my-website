 abstract = {Theorists working on information and representation are often not centrally concerned with ``Shannon'' information, as it is often put, but with some other, sometimes called ``semantic,'' kind of information. This perception is wrong. Shannon's theory of information is the only one we need. I sketch a (Shannon) informational account of representation, for a certain important family of cases. This account, which represents a significant departure from the Dretskean philosophical mainstream, will show how a number of popular proposals about the purportedly noninformational ingredients in representation actually belong in the same coherent, purely information-theoretic picture.},
