I am an assistant professor and Ramon y Cajal fellow at the [philosophy
department](https://www.ub.edu/portal/web/dp-filosofia/) of the [Universitat de
Barcelona](http://www.ub.edu/web/ub/en/index.html?). Before that, I was a
member of [Bence Nanay's research
group](http://uahost.uantwerpen.be/bence.nanay/paw.htm) at
[UAntwerpen](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/), and even before that I did
research at the [Universitat Autònoma de
Barcelona](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/) and [The Graduate Center,
CUNY](http://www.gc.cuny.edu/Page-Elements/Academics-Research-Centers-Initiatives/Doctoral-Programs/Philosophy/Philosophy).

Most of what I do is related in some way to the question of what makes
certain entities *be about*, *mean*, or *represent* others.
